# CommandsAPI

A simple .NET Core API made as practice. 
Doesn't have a lot of features, pretty bare-bones as it was my first ever made API trying to learn .NET Core development through courses.

Might use it to learn different tools.

## Changelog

1.0 - Created a Dockerfile for the project in order to run the API in a cloud server to learn how it works.
